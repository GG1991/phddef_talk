Slide 1 (title page)

The goal of this talk is to explain the work we have been done during the last year and what we plan to do in the next two
years. This work is being done at the BSC in together with the UPC, Mariano VÃ¡zquez is my director, he works at BSC and
Sergio Oller, is my co-director and he works at UPC. Thank everyone to come and I wish you to enjoy this presentation. 

The objective of my work is to develop a high performance algorithm to deal with large scale problems involving
composite materials, for example, design problems where we should prove that a specific aircraft part can resist the impact
of an object.

The method I will use it is called FE2 (fi-square) multi-scale method. This strange name is do to we perform two nested
fe calculations in the process as I will explain.

Slide 2

A composite material used in airplanes has more or less this heterogeneous structure. Obviously is more complex than
this because this drawing lies only on the 2 dimensions. Here we have a piece made of two or more materials that we 
consider homogeneous. They are joined together and this gives better properties than using only one of them for creating
that piece.

When we say that these material are homogeneous individually we mean that we know very well the constitutive laws that relates
stress with strain for each. Also how they behave in the non-linear range.

Slide 3

Particularly for aircraft composite material problems we have a very difficult issue to deal with. We know that the radius of the
smallest fiber can be of the order of a micrometer and the size of a piece can be near 1 meter for the case of a wing
panel. This means that if we want to solve directly by finite elements we would need approximately 1e6 in one of the
directions and if we solve in 3 dimension 1e18 elements. 

For sure we would like to store the solution in a vector, that would mean 1e19 bytes of memory...and only for storing
the solution.

This is a classical problem where the difference between scales makes impossible to solve by directly by the FEM.

Slide 4

Fortunately there is a general procedure called multi-scale method that decompose the big and difficult problem into
smaller ones using approximations.

The procedure is relative simple. The idea is to use a coarse mesh to represent the macroscopic problem and at the time
of calculating the constitutive relation at the integration points we use a microscopic model that returns the
microscopic quantities, for example, the stress as a function of strain that is in the macro-level. 

The micro-model should take into account enough details of the micro-structure for being accurate.

There is a wide variety of these models and most of them are based on thermodynamic principles for working accurately or 
even other physical principles and laws for being elaborated.

Slide 5

The multi-scale method in which this work is focused on is the FE2 method. This involves in obtaining the microscopical quantities
through a finite element calculation in the micro-scale. That why it is called FE2, because there 2 levels where finite
elements calculation are performed : the macroscopic and microscopic level.
